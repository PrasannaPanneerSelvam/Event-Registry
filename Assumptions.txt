Assumptions made:
    i. Event registery page can be shown only on `get all events` api success
    ii. In case of, failure on `get registered events` api, UI will be shown with zero registered events.
    iii. Available event list can be fetched in a single api request


Room for improvement:
    i. Infinite scrolling or pagination can be added for displaying a huge set of available events
